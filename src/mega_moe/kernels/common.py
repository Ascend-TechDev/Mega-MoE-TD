# BLOCK_SIZE_M is LOCKED to 64: the forward meta tiling (prepare_moe_metadata in
# _legacy_backward_golden.py) tiles tokens in BLOCK_M chunks and BOTH step1 and
# step4 consume that meta, so they must share M. K=256 (reduction tile) fills L0B
# (b-tile [256,128] bf16 = 64KB) per the Ascend 'small reduction tile -> MTE-bound'
# wiki pattern (same fix as wgrad BM=256). M=128 was tried but overflows UB with
# K=256 ([128,256]+[256,128] double-buffered = 256KB > 192KB UB) and loses the K=256
# gain at K=128 — net worse (see debug bench history).
